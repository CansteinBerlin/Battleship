# MiniMinigames
A Minecraft Spigot / Paper plugin for mini minigames that players can play. It is designed with interactability and visuality
for the player in mind and so every single game is being done in the world itself.

## Games
- Battleship (more information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)))
  
  Battleship is a strategy guessing game designed for two players. Both players have a fleet that is not visible for the other player.
  This fleet is being placed before the game begins.
  Players alternate turns by attacking each others squares on a field where the player is notified if the shot has hit a ship in the
  enemy's fleet or if the shot missed. When a ship is completely shot the ship is completely destroyed.
  
  One player wins by destroying all of the enemies ships.
